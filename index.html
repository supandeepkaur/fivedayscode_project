        <ol>
          <li>To heat a cup of water quickly and easily, microwave it for 1 minute.
        You could also heat it on the stovetop using a pot or kettle. Heat it over medium-high heat, then take the water off of the stove just before it starts to boil.</li>
          <li>For 1 serving, heat 1 cup (240 mL) of water. Use more water if you want to make additional servings.</li>
         <li>Using a kettle will make it easier to pour the hot water into your mug.</li>
         <li>Check your instant coffee container’s label to see how much you should use to get the best taste. Most companies recommend using 1 to 2 teaspoons for 1 cup (240 mL) of water</li>
         <li>Mixing the coffee with a bit of cold water gently dissolves it. Gently dissolving the coffee instead of shocking it with hot water will improve the flavor</li>
         <li>For a richer coffee flavor, add sugar or spices after mixing the coffee with hot water. If you’d like, add a teaspoon of sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, or allspice</li>
         <li>Spoon dairy milk or another non-dairy option, cream, or flavored creamer into your coffee. The right amount to use depends on how light or dark you like your coffee.</li>
         <li>Give the coffee a good stir before enjoying it or serving it to someone else. Mix it until it’s uniform in color to evenly blend the milk and sugar (if you’re using them).</li>
        </ol>
